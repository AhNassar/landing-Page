        <h2>Mercedes-Benz <span><img id=MercedesSign src="images/MERCEDES-BENZ.png" alt="Mercedes logo"></span></h2>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz is both a German automotive marque and, from late 2019 onwards, a subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz
          AG – of Daimler AG.[1]
          Mercedes-Benz is known for producing luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles. The headquarters is in
          Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg. The name first appeared in 1926 as Daimler-Benz.[clarification needed] In 2018,
          Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger
          cars.[8]
          The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz
          Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
          automobile. The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin. The
          slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</p>

        <!-- ABOUT Audi Wikipedia-->
        <h2>Audi<span><img src="images/AUDI.png" alt="Audi logo"></span></h2>
        <p>Audi AG (German: [ˈaʊ̯di ʔaːˈɡeː] (About this soundlisten)) is a German automobile manufacturer that designs,
          engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles. Audi is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
          Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine
          production facilities worldwide.

          The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises
          (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer),
          leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when
          Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[10] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965
          introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus
          creating the present day form of the company.

          The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. "Horch",
          meaning "listen" in German, becomes "audi" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of
          four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is
          Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning "Being Ahead through Technology".[11] Audi, along with fellow German marques
          BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.</p>
